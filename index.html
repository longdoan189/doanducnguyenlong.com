								<h2 id="w_introt">Introduction</h2>
								<p id="w_introse1">Ah right, I should have introduced myself first. My name is Đoàn Đức Nguyên Long (Too long? You can call me Long). I am currently a cybersecurity student at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uni.lu">University of Luxembourg.</a> </p>
								<p id="w_introse2">I have an adequate interest in computers and football. I enjoy finding bugs and helping people on computers (and sometimes math, somehow). I often work with Python (to the point of even understanding its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">abstract syntax tree</a>; and also Javascript, obviously (HTML and CSS do not count, I know). </p>
								<p id="w_introse3">Feel free to take a look around (currently there is only my CV page, but things will be added soon). This is not a museum, so feel free to touch around also. </p>
