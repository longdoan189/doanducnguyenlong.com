								<h2 id="w_introt">Introduction</h2>
								<p id="w_introse1">Ah right, I should have introduced myself first. My name is Đoàn Đức Nguyên Long (ignore those funny character, just call me Long). I am currently a cybersecurity student at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uni.lu">University of Luxembourg.</a> </p>
								<p id="w_introse2">As you could have guessed, I have an adequate interested in computer (to study cybersecurity). I enjoy finding bugs and helping people on computer (and sometimes math, somehow). I often work with Python (to the point of even understading its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">abstract syntax tree</a>. Aside from Python, I also worked with C++, Java, Julia, and Assembly. Um and also Javascript, obviously (HTML and CSS does not count, I know). </p>
								<p id="w_introse3">Outside of computer (or technically not), my favourite hobbies are sports and chess (including xiangqi and shogi). I love to play football and pickleball and regularly jogging. You can communicate with me in my native language Vietnamese (preferable). Or like what you read here, English. I am learning German so that is leaving for the future. Oh, if you are silly enough then we could also speak toki pona. </p>
								<p id="w_introse4">Feel free to take a look around (currently there is only my CV page, but things will be added soon). This is not a museum, so feel free to touch around also. </p>
