									<p id="w_master">Currently, I am a master's student at the University of Luxembourg in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/study-programs/master-in-cybersecurity-and-cyber-defence/"><i>cybersecurity</i></a>. </p>
									<p id="w_bachelor">I finished my bachelor's programme in Computer Science at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fuv.edu.vn"><i>Fulbright University Vietnam</i></a>. I was honoured to enrol there as a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fulbright.edu.vn/fulbright-welcomes-fifty-six-students-to-the-co-design-year/"><i>co-designer</i></a>. Co-designers are the very first students at the university. The co-design year was the year students worked with faculty to build the foundation for Fulbright University Vietnam. During my bachelor's programme, I also had an exchange programme at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html"><i>Saarland University</i></a> in Germany. </p>
									<p id="w_fullstack">I have also completed an eight-month Full-stack boot camp during 2021 at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cybersoft.edu.vn/"><i>CyberSoft Academy</i></a>. I learned about React and Angular for the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end (but this website ended up in VanillaJS).</p>
									<p id="w_highschool">I graduated high school in 2018 at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lsts.edu.vn/en"><i>Lawrence S.Ting School</i></a> in Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon.</p>

									<h2 id="w_working">Working experience</h2>
									<p id="w_itechwx">From July 2023 to September 2024 I was a Technical Engineer and later Technical Advisor at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.itechwx.com/"><i>iTechwx</i></a>. My role was working with customers to resolve complex technical customer issues on the Microsoft Azure Platform as well as Windows Server that related to the authentication process (in simpler words: IT mates have problems with their user's login and I help them). This role is interesting and allows me to understand the application of cybersecurity to industrial products.  </p>
									<p id="w_coderschool"> From June 2021 to August 2021 (during my bachelor's summer vacation), I had an internship at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.coderschool.vn/en"><i>CoderSchool</i></a> to develop an automated grading system for machine learning courses organised by the institution to help students' assessment easier. Previously, lecturers had to grade student's homework by hand for every student. With this auto-grader, this can be done en-masse, allowing the class to scale up. </p>
									<p id="w_codeinplace"> In May 2021, I was a lecturer at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/"><i>Code in Place</i></a>. This online course was offered by Stanford University during the COVID-19. As a volunteer section leader, I prepared and taught a weekly discussion section of 8-10 students to supplement professors' lectures. </p>
									<p id="w_fuvjob">From October 2020 to April 2021, I was a math mentor for Fulbright University Vietnam. I helped other Math students in my university to overcome the difficulties they encountered, including explaining new concepts and giving advice to be better in Math. </p>
