									<p id="w_master">I am currently a master student at University of Luxembourg in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/study-programs/master-in-cybersecurity-and-cyber-defence/"><i>cybersecurity</i></a>. </p>
									<p id="w_bachelor">I finished my bachelor's programme at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fuv.edu.vn"><i>Fulbright University Vietnam</i></a> in Computer Science. I was honour to enrol there as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fulbright.edu.vn/fulbright-welcomes-fifty-six-students-to-the-co-design-year/"><i>co-designer</i></a>, who are the very first student at the university. The co-design year also allow student to work with faculty to build foundation for Fulbright University Vietnam. The liberal art philosophy of the universty has greatly helped me to discover my interests and strenghten my skills. </p>
									<p id="w_exchange">During my bachelor's programme, I have also had an exchange programme at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html"><i>Saarland University</i></a> in cybersecurity in Germany. There, I was introduced to many new knowledge about the field that helps me on my master programme and future career. </p>
									<p id="w_highschool">I graduated highschool in 2018 at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lsts.edu.vn/en"><i>Lawrence S.Ting School</i></a> in Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon.</p>
									<p id="w_fullstack">I have also completed a 8 months Full-Stack bootcamp during 2021 at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cybersoft.edu.vn/"><i>CyberSoft Academy</i></a>.</p>

									<h2 id="w_working">Working experience</h2>
									<p id="w_itechwx">From July 2023 to September 2024 I was a Technical Engineer and later Technical Advisor at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.itechwx.com/"><i>iTechwx</i></a>. My role was working with customers to resolve complex technical customer issues on the Microsoft Azure Platform as well as Windows Server that related to authentication process (in simplier words: IT mates have problem with their user's login and I help them). This role is interesting and allow me to understand application of cybersecurity into industrial products as well as understand the IT industry in general from customer.  </p>
									<p id="w_coderschool"> From June 2021 to August 2021 (during my bachelor's summer vacation), I had an internship at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.coderschool.vn/en"><i>CoderSchool</i></a> to develop an automated grading system for machine learning courses organised by the institution to help students' assessment easier. Previously, lecturers have to grade student's homework by hand for every student. With this autograder, this can be done en masse, allowing the class to scale up. </p>
									<p id="w_codeinplace"> In May 2021, I was a lecturer at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/"><i>Code in Place</i></a>. This online course was offered by Stanford University during the COVID-19. As a volunteer section leader, I prepared and taught a weekly discussion section of 8-10 students to supplement professors' lectures. </p>
									<p id="w_fuvjob">From October 2020 to April 2021, I was a math mentor for Fulbright University Vietnam. My role was to help student (both with or without math background) to understand the concepts and be able to apply it for their study. </p>
